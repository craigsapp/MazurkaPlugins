@NAME: MzSpectrogramFFTW
@APROPOS: Demonstration of how to create spectral data using FFTW from 
        time data supplied by a host application.

@SUMMARY:  The MzSpectrogramFFTW plugin accepts time-sequence audio
	data as input from the host application and applies a Fourier 
	transform to the data generate a spectrum.  The plugin then
	calculates and outputs the non-negative frequency magnitude 
	spectrum.

@PARAMETERS:

@OUTPUTS:
@OUTPUT01: The magnitude spectrogram

@DESCRIPTION:  The MzSpectrogramFFTW plugin produces the same
output as the <a class=link href=../MzSpectrogramClient>MzSpectrogramClient</a>
plugin.
The difference between the two plugins is how the output is produced.
MzSpectrogramClient calculates with a basic FFT algorithm, while
MzSpectrogramFFTW calculates with a sophisticated FFT algorithm
which is 3 to 4 times faster.
So in the long run, you will save lots of time using the FFTW transforms
rather than a basic FFT algorithm (although it will take <i>a lot</i>
more time to get things compiled the first time using FFTW).

<p> MzSpectogramFFT is a useful template for how to write your
own frequency analysis plugin where more control over the transform
process is necessary, or you want to implement a transform other than
a Discrete Fourier Transform, such as a wavelet transform.  
Also, the analysis window applied to the audio signal in MzSpectrogramHost
is controlled by the host (usually selected by the user, or set to a
default type).  If your plugin needs a specific analysis window which
cannot be supplied by the host, then you should use a client-based
transform as given in this example plugin.

   <li> <a class=link href=../MzSpectrogramHost>MzSpectrogramHost</a> -- 
	demonstrates how to receive and process spectral data from 
        the host application.
   <li> <a class=link href=../MzSpectrogramHost>MzSpectrogramClient</a> --
        demonstrates how to generate and process spectral data generated
        from time data provided by the host application.
   <li> MzSpectrogramFFTW -- described on this page: demonstrates how
        to do three-to-four times faster Fourier transforms than MzSpectrgramClient.
   <li> <a class=link href=../MzNevermore>MzNevermore</a> -- a full-featured
        Spectrogram display function based on MzSpectrgramFFTW.
