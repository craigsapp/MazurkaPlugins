@NAME: MzAttack
@APROPOS: Identify note attacks in the audio data.

@SUMMARY:  Generates a detection function and also uses that function
to decide where actual  note attacks in the audio are located.


@BEGIN:	PARAMETERS
@END:	PARAMETERS


@BEGIN:	OUTPUTS

@OUTPUT01: Attack detection function:
	A function in the range from 0 to 1.  A value of 0 means
        that a note attack at that time in the audio is very 
        unlikely.  A value above 0.2 means that the existance of
        an attack at that location in time is highly likely.

@OUTPUT02: Detected attacks:
	Using the attack detection function, this output gives
	estimated locations of note attacks in the audio data.
        
@END:	OUTPUTS


@DESCRIPTION:  

<p> Here is an example output display from MzAttack:

<p>

</center>

<p>The black curve is the <i>attack detection function</i>, 
and the orange lines are the <i>detected attacks</i>.  The
output data is super-imposed on top of the original audio waveform
which is shown in purple.



@LIMITATIONS: 
  Initial draft of the plugin, should improve with some more work.
  The detected attacks contains significant false negatives, but
  not too many false positives.
