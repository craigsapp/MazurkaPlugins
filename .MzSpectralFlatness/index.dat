@NAME: MzSpectralFlatness
@APROPOS: Measure the spectral flatness of a signal

@SUMMARY:  


@BEGIN:	PARAMETERS

@PARAMETER01: Window Size: 
		The size of the audio analysis window in samples for 
		calculating underlying spectra.  Window sizes under 
		1024 samples do not seem to be useful for calculating 
		the spectral flux.  Larger window sizes do seem to 
		reduce some noise due to beating of partials in 
		pitched music.

@PARAMETER02: Step Size: 
		The number of samples between analysis window starting
		points.  The peak-finding algorithm is currently optimized
		to a step size of 10 milliseconds which corresponds
		to 441 samples when the sampling rate is 44100 Hz.
		Probably not useful to alter this value since some of the
		peak finding parameters are not yet adjustable by the user.

@END:	PARAMETERS


@BEGIN:	OUTPUTS

@OUTPUT01: Spectral Flatness:
	This is the raw spectral flatness value at each point 
	in the audio signal.

@OUTPUT02: Smoothed Spectral Flatness:
	The exponentially smoothed spectral flatness value 
	at each point in the audio signal.

@OUTPUT03: Geometric Mean:
	The geometric mean of the spectrum which is the numerator
	in the spectral flatness calculation.

@OUTPUT04: Arithmetic Mean:
	The arithmetic mean of the spectrum which is the denominator
	in the spectral flatness calculation.


@END:	OUTPUTS


@DESCRIPTION:  


<h2>Spectral flatness<hr noshade></h2>

Spectral flatness is a measure of noise vs. sinewaves in an audio signal.
A low value of flatness indicates the presence of sinewaves in the audio 
signal, and high values indicate the presence of noise.

<div id=latexeqn name=spectralflux size=+1>
\mbox{spectral flatness} & = & \frac{\mbox{\scriptsize geometric mean}}{\mbox{\scriptsize arithmetic mean}} \\
%   & =  & \frac{\left(\displaystyle\prod_k x(k)\right)^{1/N}} {\frac{1}{N} \displaystyle\sum_k x(k)} \\
   & =  & \frac{\sqrt[N]{\displaystyle\prod_k x(k)}} {\frac{1}{N} \displaystyle\sum_k x(k)}
</div>

Where <i>x</i> is a spectrum, <i>k</i> is an index into the spectrum, and
<i>N</i> is the number of (non-zero) elements in the spectrum.
